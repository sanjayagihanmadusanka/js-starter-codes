argument - real, parameter - name of the variable that holds arguments

extra arguments are handled in JS functions (since JS doesn’t throw an error if you pass too many/few)

In JavaScript, when you pass fewer arguments than the function’s parameters:The missing parameters are automatically assigned the value undefined.

Using new Array(size) makes sense only when you know the length in advance and want to preallocate an array of that size. For example:
let arr = new Array(5);
console.log(arr); // [ <5 empty items> ]
console.log(arr.length); // 5
let arr = new Array(1,2,3) //[ 1, 2, 3 ]

undefined - when we try to access properties of objects that doesn't defined

In JavaScript, arrays are not type-restricted.
const arr = ["car", 5, true]; //valid

Function Declarations → can be used anywhere in their scope, even before the line of code. (function(){})
Function Expressions → can only be used after the line of code is executed. (()=> {})

Without declaration → creates a global variable (if not in strict mode).
In strict mode → throws a ReferenceError.
